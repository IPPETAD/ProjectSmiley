You'll need octave 3.8.1+ to run the included packages. They won't
work on ohaton, since the server's missing some required libraries
(well -- something's broken, I dunno).

Run the the following once, since it will install the packages for
you:

> pkg install packages/*

You can ensure it is all installed with:

> pkg list
